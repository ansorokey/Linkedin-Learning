# Typescript Essentials

## Introduction
### Why TypeScript?
Javascript is a very versatile and forgiving programing language. But that 'forgiving' nature can also allow cracks in code where mistakes and program breaking bugs can occur. Some obvious, some difficult to find.

TypeScript is a superset of JS, meaning it extends the functionality of JS. It also adds strong static typing on top of JS, which allows code to be checked during compile time instead of runtime (meaning as we build it, instead of having to run the program to find an error). It adds inline documentation and guidance.

TS compiles down to JS, so anywhere you can use JS, you an use TS.

TS is created and managed by microsoft, so documentation is A+!
